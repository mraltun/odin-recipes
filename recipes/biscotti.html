      This is a simple, no frills biscotti. My friend at work gave this recipe
      to me. It's quick, easy and one of my favorite Italian cookie recipes.
    </h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon anise extract, or 3 drops anise oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or
      line with parchment paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a medium bowl, beat together the oil, eggs, sugar and anise flavoring
      until well blended. Combine the flour and baking powder, stir into the egg
      mixture to form a heavy dough. Divide dough into two pieces. Form each
      piece into a roll as long as your cookie sheet. Place roll onto the
      prepared cookie sheet, and press down to 1/2 inch thickness.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
      Remove from the baking sheet to cool on a wire rack. When The cookies are
      cool enough to handle, slice each one crosswise into 1/2 inch slices.
      Place the slices cut side up back onto the baking sheet. Bake for an
      additional 6 to 10 minutes on each side. Slices should be lightly toasted.
